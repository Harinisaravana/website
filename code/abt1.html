        <p>If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we’d all be much happier. However, unlike food based recipes, life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives their unique life.

            It means we must ‘cook’ with what we have and see what we can come up with it. Depending on our knowledge of our ingredients and the objective we wish to will establish how difficult it would be to ‘cook up’ our desired results.
            
            However, just like cooking…life has a lot of similarities. For instance, while some people like to follow the recipe to the core, others like to experiment with the ingredients creating their unique take on something that might have been passed down from generation to generation. We can see this as the traditionalist versus the progressive. One likes to keep the way things are while the other doesn’t fear to embark in new terrains.</p>
